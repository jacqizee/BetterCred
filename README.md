## The Brief

**Timeframe:**
* 9 days

**General Project Brief:**
* Build a full-stack application by making your own backend and your own front-end
* Use a Python Django API using Django REST Framework to serve your data from a Postgres database
* Consume your API with a separate front-end built with React
* Be a complete product which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* Have a visually impressive design

## Technologies 

* JavaScript (ES6+)
* Python
* Django
* React & React Router
* Material UI (MUI)
* HTML5, CSS3, and SASS
* Axios
* VSCode
* Pylint
* Git & GitHub
* TablePlus
* Insomnia

## Planning

My initial plan for this project was to create an app that made it easy for users to browse many different credit cards, allowing them to find cards with the features that would be most useful based on their own lifestyle preferences. If a user decides they like a certain card, they'd be able to save them to their user profile in a virtual 'wallet' of sorts, which helps them organize the cards they may have already applied for or would like to apply for in the future.

### Features

* Homepage
* Login/Register forms in the form of modals
* Card Explore Page - topline information on different credit cards
* Card Show Page - more detailed information on a specific credit card
* Add to Wallet - users can add cards to their digital "wallet" by clicking a button on the card show page
* User Wallet Page - where a user can view cards they have saved to their wallet
* Edit Profile Page - change name, password, email, or username
* Responsive Design
* Dark Mode
